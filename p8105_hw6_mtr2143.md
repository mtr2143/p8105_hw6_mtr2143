# Problem 1

``` r
birthweight_data <- read_csv("https://www.p8105.com/data/birthweight.csv")

birthweight_missing <- map_df(birthweight_data, ~sum(is.na(.))) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = babysex:wtgain,
    names_to = "variable", 
    values_to = "num_missing"
  )

birthweight_missing %>% kable()
```

| variable | num_missing |
|:---------|------------:|
| babysex  |           0 |
| bhead    |           0 |
| blength  |           0 |
| bwt      |           0 |
| delwt    |           0 |
| fincome  |           0 |
| frace    |           0 |
| gaweeks  |           0 |
| malform  |           0 |
| menarche |           0 |
| mheight  |           0 |
| momage   |           0 |
| mrace    |           0 |
| parity   |           0 |
| pnumlbw  |           0 |
| pnumsga  |           0 |
| ppbmi    |           0 |
| ppwt     |           0 |
| smoken   |           0 |
| wtgain   |           0 |

From the table above, we can see that none of the variables contain any
NA values.

``` r
birthweight_data %>% 
  group_by(frace) %>% 
  summarize(
    total = n()
  ) %>% 
  kable()
```

| frace | total |
|------:|------:|
|     1 |  2123 |
|     2 |  1911 |
|     3 |    46 |
|     4 |   248 |
|     8 |    14 |

Per the data description, we know that the variable correspond to the
father’s race has a value for observations where the value is unknown
(`frace == 9`), However, from the table above, we can see that there
aren’t any observations that have this value.

Now that we know there aren’t any missing values, we can fit a model.

``` r
birthweight_df <-
  birthweight_data %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = ifelse(babysex == 1, "male", "female") %>% 
      forcats::as_factor(),
    frace = case_when(
      frace == 1 ~ "white", 
      frace == 2 ~ "black", 
      frace == 3 ~ "asian", 
      frace == 4 ~ "puerto rican", 
      frace == 8 ~ "other"
    ) %>% 
      forcats::as_factor(),
    malform = ifelse(malform == 0, "absent", "present") %>% 
      forcats::as_factor(), 
    mrace = case_when(
      mrace == 1 ~ "white", 
      mrace == 2 ~ "black", 
      mrace == 3 ~ "asian", 
      mrace == 4 ~ "puerto rican", 
      mrace == 8 ~ "other"
    ) %>% 
      forcats::as_factor()
  )
```
