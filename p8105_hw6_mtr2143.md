# Problem 1

``` r
birthweight_data <- read_csv("https://www.p8105.com/data/birthweight.csv")

birthweight_missing <- map_df(birthweight_data, ~sum(is.na(.))) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = babysex:wtgain,
    names_to = "variable", 
    values_to = "num_missing"
  )

birthweight_missing %>% kable()
```

| variable | num_missing |
|:---------|------------:|
| babysex  |           0 |
| bhead    |           0 |
| blength  |           0 |
| bwt      |           0 |
| delwt    |           0 |
| fincome  |           0 |
| frace    |           0 |
| gaweeks  |           0 |
| malform  |           0 |
| menarche |           0 |
| mheight  |           0 |
| momage   |           0 |
| mrace    |           0 |
| parity   |           0 |
| pnumlbw  |           0 |
| pnumsga  |           0 |
| ppbmi    |           0 |
| ppwt     |           0 |
| smoken   |           0 |
| wtgain   |           0 |

From the table above, we can see that none of the variables contain any
NA values.

``` r
birthweight_data %>% 
  group_by(frace) %>% 
  summarize(
    total = n()
  ) %>% 
  kable()
```

| frace | total |
|------:|------:|
|     1 |  2123 |
|     2 |  1911 |
|     3 |    46 |
|     4 |   248 |
|     8 |    14 |

Per the data description, we know that the variable correspond to the
father’s race has a value for observations where the value is unknown
(`frace == 9`), However, from the table above, we can see that there
aren’t any observations that have this value.

Now that we know there aren’t any missing values, we can fit a model.

``` r
birthweight_df <-
  birthweight_data %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = ifelse(babysex == 1, "male", "female") %>% 
      forcats::as_factor() %>% 
      relevel(ref = "male"),
    frace = case_when(
      frace == 1 ~ "white", 
      frace == 2 ~ "black", 
      frace == 3 ~ "asian", 
      frace == 4 ~ "puerto rican", 
      frace == 8 ~ "other"
    ) %>% 
      forcats::as_factor() %>% 
      relevel(ref = "other"),
    malform = ifelse(malform == 0, "absent", "present") %>% 
      forcats::as_factor() %>% 
      relevel(ref = "absent"), 
    mrace = case_when(
      mrace == 1 ~ "white", 
      mrace == 2 ~ "black", 
      mrace == 3 ~ "asian", 
      mrace == 4 ~ "puerto rican"
    ) %>% 
      forcats::as_factor() %>% 
      relevel(ref = "puerto rican")
  )
```

``` r
bwt_fit <- lm(bwt ~ fincome + frace + gaweeks + mrace + momage + smoken, data = birthweight_df)

bwt_fit %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  select(term, estimate, p.value) %>% 
  mutate(
    term = str_replace(term, "^frace", "frace: "), 
    term = str_replace(term, "^mrace", "mrace: ")
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 3)
```

| term                | estimate | p.value |
|:--------------------|---------:|--------:|
| (Intercept)         |  762.535 |   0.000 |
| fincome             |    0.412 |   0.158 |
| frace: white        |    1.005 |   0.993 |
| frace: black        |  -40.796 |   0.759 |
| frace: asian        |  -12.476 |   0.938 |
| frace: puerto rican |  -49.264 |   0.721 |
| gaweeks             |   59.453 |   0.000 |
| mrace: white        |  135.953 |   0.064 |
| mrace: black        |  -96.733 |   0.274 |
| mrace: asian        |  -30.655 |   0.817 |
| momage              |    1.517 |   0.431 |
| smoken              |  -10.878 |   0.000 |

I chose to run a model where baby’s birthweight (g) is predicted by
family income, father’s race, gestational age at delivery (weeks),
mother’s race, mother’s age at delivery (years), and average number of
cigarettes smoked per day during pregnancy. The goal of this model was
to predict birthweight based on known biological factors that influence
birthweight (gestational age and number of cigarettes smoked during
pregnancy) with social factor (family income and father and mother’s
race).

``` r
birthweight_df %>% 
  modelr::add_predictions(bwt_fit) %>% 
  modelr::add_residuals(bwt_fit) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = pred, y = resid)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = .3) +
  xlab("Predicted Value") + ylab("Residual")
```

The above plot shows the residuals vs the predicted values. For the
assumption of linearity to be hold, we’d expect the points to be
distributed randomly around y = 0, but that is not true of this model.
There also appears to be outliers present in our data given the points
that are far outside the main clustering of where the predicted value is
between 2500 and 2500 and the residual is 0.

``` r
set.seed(32694)

cv_df <- 
  birthweight_df %>% 
  crossv_mc(., 100)

cv_df <-
  cv_df %>% 
  mutate(
    my_mod = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ fincome + frace + gaweeks + mrace + momage + smoken, data = .x)),
    main_mod = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ blength + gaweeks, data = .x)), 
    inter_mod = map(train, ~lm(bwt ~ bhead * babysex * blength, data = .x))
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    rmse_my_model = map2_dbl(my_mod, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)), 
    rmse_main_effects = map2_dbl(main_mod, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
    rmse_interaction = map2_dbl(inter_mod, test, ~rmse(model = .x, data = .y)),
  )

cv_df %>% 
  select(
    starts_with("rmse")
    ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    everything(),
    names_to = "model", 
    values_to = "rmse",
    names_prefix = "rmse_") %>% 
  mutate(
    model = fct_inorder(model)
    ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = model, y = rmse)) + 
  geom_violin() +
  xlab("Model") + ylab("RMSE")
```

![](p8105_hw6_mtr2143_files/figure-gfm/model%20comparison-1.png)<!-- -->

From the plot above, we can see the model I fit is by far the worst.
Judging by the RMSE, the model with the three-way interaction is the
best predictor of a baby’s birthweight. However, given that a model with
interaction is difficult to describe, I’d argue that the main effect
model is the best model.

# Problem 2

``` r
weather_df <- 
  rnoaa::meteo_pull_monitors(
    c("USW00094728"),
    var = c("PRCP", "TMIN", "TMAX"), 
    date_min = "2017-01-01",
    date_max = "2017-12-31") %>%
  mutate(
    name = recode(id, USW00094728 = "CentralPark_NY"),
    tmin = tmin / 10,
    tmax = tmax / 10) %>%
  select(name, id, everything())
```
